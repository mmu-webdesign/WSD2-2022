# Quality Audit

Including...

## HTML Validation

Quality and efficiency of your code. If you have implemented code that does not validate you need to explain why.
I ran each page of our site through the W3C Validation service and the same errors appeared in each.

Error 1:

<img src="sp6-media/image-1.jpg" alt="Safia's Prototype">

All of the pictures that we had embedded into the site had this problem. We had essentially added in a trailing slash which had no useful effect on the page. I therefore went through and deleted these from every image across the site. 

Error 2:

insert image 2

There were a few element end tags left after copying code between pages which had no use therefore these were removed across all page.

Error 3:

insert image 3

This was also consistent across all pages right at the bottom. it was simply a script type tag dictating that we were using javascript which was unnecessary and was left over from the template that we built the web pages from.


## CSS Validation

Quality and efficiency.

## Speed test (inc. optimisation of code and media)

Download speeds. Are there any _blockers_. Are images optimised?

## Readability testing

Test at least some of your text. Think of your type of users and the levels they would expect.

Also test your grammar and spelling as this will lose you credibility (**and marks**).

## SEO

Review your metadata (Checkbot will help) including page titles, meta description, link text, use of headings, use of keywords in your text.
