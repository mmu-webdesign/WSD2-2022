# Accessibility audit

For the accessibility audit, we used the WCAG checklist to ensure that we included all the required elements and options on the website. The core issue we focused on was using semantic features for the page structure, good colour contrast, and relevant alt text for all the images included. All these accessibility options helped us ensure that we code a website that passes the userâ€™s requirements and is easy to use to its users.

However, some of the options in the checklist were not ticked off because we did not include these features. Which mostly were the options for adding media assets like audio and video to the web pages. We did not include that because we did not want to make the website slow when opened, which would have affected the user experience.
